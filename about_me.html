            <h2>My Bio</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm a passionate, self-taught frontend developer embarking on an exciting journey with the HNG Internship program. 
                My path into web development started with curiosity about how websites work, and has evolved into a deep 
                commitment to creating accessible, beautiful, and functional web experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in the power of clean code, semantic HTML, and user-centered design. Every project is an 
                opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute to the web development community. When I'm not coding, 
                I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, and volunteering my skills to help 
                organizations achieve their digital goals.

            <h2>My Goals in This Program</h2>
            <p>
                Participating in the HNG Internship is a strategic step in my development career. Here's what I aim to achieve:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Master modern frontend frameworks</span> and build production-ready applications</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Deepen my understanding</span> of web accessibility standards and best practices</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Collaborate with talented developers</span> and learn from real-world project experiences</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Build a strong portfolio</span> of projects that demonstrate my technical skills</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Contribute meaningfully</span> to team projects and open source initiatives</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Network with industry professionals</span> and establish lasting connections in the tech community</li>

        <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
            <h2>Areas Where I'm Building Confidence</h2>
            <p>
                Growth happens outside our comfort zone. I'm actively working on strengthening my skills in:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Advanced JavaScript patterns</span> - particularly closures, async/await, and functional programming concepts</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">CSS animations and transitions</span> - creating smooth, performant animations that enhance UX</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Testing and debugging</span> - writing comprehensive tests and efficiently troubleshooting issues</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Backend integration</span> - working confidently with APIs and understanding full-stack architecture</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Performance optimization</span> - identifying bottlenecks and implementing best practices for speed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I view these areas not as weaknesses but as opportunities for focused growth. Each challenge is a stepping 
                stone toward becoming a more well-rounded developer.

            <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
            <p>
                Dear Future Echika,
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember this moment - the excitement, the nervousness, the determination to succeed. You're taking on 
                this internship while managing other commitments, proving your dedication to continuous growth. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When you look back at this code, you'll probably cringe at some decisions, and that's perfectly okay. 
                That's evidence of growth. Keep that beginner's mindset - stay curious, stay humble, and never stop learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                The late nights, the debugging sessions, the "aha!" moments - they're all worth it. You chose to invest 
                in yourself, to push through challenges, and to build something meaningful. Trust the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keep building, keep learning, and keep sharing your knowledge with others. The best is yet to come.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: right; font-style: italic; margin-top: 1rem;">

            <h2>Extra Thoughts & Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                This journey with HNG comes at a pivotal time. Balancing volunteer work, motherhood, house-chores, learning, and this internship 
                teaches me valuable lessons about time management, priority setting, and the importance of community.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've learned that contributing to real-world projects - whether through internships or volunteer work - 
                provides insights that tutorials alone cannot offer. The challenge of meeting deadlines, adhering to 
                standards, and collaborating with others shapes us into professional developers.
            </p>
            <p>
                My philosophy is simple: <span class="highlight">write code that others can understand, create experiences 
                that users will love, and always leave the codebase better than you found it.</span> Every commit is a 
                chance to demonstrate care, attention to detail, and respect for the craft.
            </p>
            <p>
                To anyone reading this: whether you're a fellow intern, a reviewer, or my future self - thank you for 
                being part of this journey. Let's build something amazing together.
